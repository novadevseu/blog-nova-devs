## 🔥 Why Firebase?

Firebase is a powerful backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that provides essential tools for modern web applications. We chose Firebase for:

- **Firestore Database** 📂: A flexible, NoSQL cloud database that syncs data in real-time.

By integrating Firebase, we ensure **fast, secure, and reliable performance**, making it an excellent choice for an Open Source blogging platform.
